# ShadowsandEternity
Shadows and Eternity is a sci-fi text-based adventure game made for the Arduboy. Your goal is to survive the day, if you can.

This also happens to be a resurrection project of spaceneedle’s GameTextInterpreter (GTI) engine. I’ve used the update provided by the wonderful Mr.Blinky, am working to update it and make some changes.

I hope in the end it’s a useful tool for making text-based games on the Arduboy!
